# CGIAR-Data-Showcase
Climate change has taken centre stage in recent years owing to the catastrophic effects it has on the environment. One of the climatic concerns is that of temperature change, hence organisations such as ICRISAT, research on drought-resilient crops. It is important to marry the climatic factor with that of food security. The world growing population will need sustenance regardless of failing mother nature. Temperature change and crop yield datasets were downloaded from the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO) website [link supplied at the end]. 
Continental datasets from 1961-2018 were analysed, and a 10-year forecast horizon using the Exponential Smoothing model was arrived at. There is a strong correlation between temperature changes and the crop yield except for the European area. For the next coming 10 years, the temperature change will linearly increase. The same phenomenon will be observed in the crop yields (Hg/Ha) harvested in Africa and Asia, unfortunately, this will not be registered in the other continents, if all things are held constant. More research in resiliency will be needed to match the impending volatile temperature changes to have a food secure world. http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/QC
